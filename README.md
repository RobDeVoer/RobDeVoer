### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I dont like listing my profile as it seems to much like a boast. Hereby a broad overview since without it you would not know what questions/situations I may be able to add value so here I go:

Rob retired last year after a life designing and building high tech products and doing a few startup companies (only two succeeded). Rob started in Basic, then Assembly, C, C++ and now C#. Rob started early stage web development with CGI and SGML and continued all the way. Rob's preferred environment is NET6 with MVC and EF with tentative steps into Blazor. Rob also enjoys building Iot devices and automating home and garden, currently using C++ and PlatformIO for the embedded code.

As a CTO/development manager Rob enjoyed building great teams along the way touching many development models and communication models.

I have extensive experience designing and developing large solutions but also multi platform tools and utilities. Having been a leader for 25+ years adds Leadership, project management, quality assurance, SDLC and transitioning teams to TDD to my repertoire.

Now that Rob no longer works he spends time daily to improve his skills and learn new technologies and techniques. Among other things he enjoys the ins & outs and new versions of C#, VS2022, VS Code, MSSQL, JS, TS, HTML, CSS, etcetera.

Rob loves being a sound board and offering my experience to help others.

Thats why I am here: to engage, learn, share and have fun with technology.

I look forward to connect with you and hear what you are up to.

Cheers,
Rob
