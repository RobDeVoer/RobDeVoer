### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I dont like listing my profile as it seems to much like a boast. I have to give you a broads overview however since without it you would not know what questions/situations I may be able to add value so here I go:

I retired last year after a lengthy career designing and building high tech products and doing a few startup companies (only two succeeded). I started in Assembly, moved to C, C++ and C#. Was involved in early stage web development with CGI and SGML and continued all the way. My preferred environment now is NET6 with MVC and EF. I enjoy building Iot devices and automating my home and garden, currently using C++ and PlatformIO for the embedded code.

As a CTO/development manager I enjoyed building great teams along the way touching many development models and communication models.

I have extensive experience designing and developing large solutions but also multi platform tools and utilities. Having been a leader for 25+ years adds Leadership, project management, quality assurance, SDLC and transitioning teams to TDD to my repertoire.

My skills have been fun to build and now that I can do what I want I keep learning daily to improve my understanding of the ins & outs and new versions of C#, VS2022, VS Code, MSSQL, JS, TS, HTML, CSS... etc. etc.

I love being a sound board and offering my experience to help others.

Thats why I am here: to engage, learn, share and have fun with technology.

I look forward to connect with you and hear what you are up to.

Cheers,
Rob
